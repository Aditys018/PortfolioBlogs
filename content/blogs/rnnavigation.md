## Introduction

Navigation is the backbone of any mobile application, but with React Native, it can quickly become a tangled web—especially when you're using deep linking, authentication, and modals all in one app.

In this post, I’ll walk you through the issues I faced while working with complex navigation flows in a React Native project using Expo, and how I ended up simplifying it with Expo Router.

## The Problem

Initially, I was using `react-navigation` with manual route configurations. But as the app grew, I faced several issues:

- **Deep Linking Breakage**: Links wouldn’t always open the correct screen, especially on Android.
- **Redundant Route Definitions**: Maintaining separate stacks for auth, modals, and main screens led to a lot of duplication.
- **No Clear Structure**: It was hard to track which component was navigating where—everything was scattered.

## Solution

After exploring a few options, I switched to **Expo Router**. It felt like how routing should work in a mobile app—file-based, scalable, and declarative.

Here’s what improved:

- **Directory-Based Routing**: The folder structure defined the routes, making it much easier to manage and visualize the navigation tree.
- **Shared Layouts**: I could define layout components at the folder level—perfect for shared headers, tabs, or bottom navigation.
- **Better Deep Link Support**: Expo Router handled deep linking out-of-the-box with minimal setup.

## Key Takeaways

- Use `app/_layout.js` or `app/_layout.tsx` wisely for wrapping screens in tabs or stack layouts.
- Organize modals inside `app/modal/` and nest dynamic routes like `[id].js` for clean detail views.
- Keep navigation logic declarative—don’t push and pop manually unless you really need to.

## Conclusion

If you're building a React Native app and struggling with navigation, I strongly recommend trying Expo Router. It simplifies routing, improves maintainability, and just makes the developer experience more pleasant.
